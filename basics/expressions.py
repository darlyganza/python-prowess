# Python expressions follow the order of strength where some expressions like in mathematics BODMAS are strictly
# followed
print ((12-3)*3)
# the brackets are of more importance in this case
print(12**2)
# Double * for expressions

# floor division (no points left after division
print(13//2)
# Rounding off floating point numbers:
x = 123.4457923
print(round(x,2))
# using the float round without specifying the number of decimal digits to round to will round it to the nearest int
